# Advent of Code (2022)

Here you'll find my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022 edition. Each folder is a day, and each day has two parts. Each one has an `input` and an `example` of input.

## How to run

```sh
cd 02
python part_1.py < input.txt # running with the input
python part_1.py < example.txt # running with the example
```
